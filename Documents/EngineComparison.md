-1 similarity + 1 difference you noticed across Unity / Unreal / Godot while importing Kenney assets + building the level:
All three are very easy to import assets, as you simply have to drag and drop the folder from your file explorer into the program's content browser equivalent. Unreal was the easiest to get objects to line up precisely as the incremental grid-based rotations, translations and scaling are on by default. Unity is nice in getting objects in precise spots on the grid if you know the correct rotations and positioning off the top of your head. Godot seemed the best for just throwing things in if you do not care about exact positioning or lining up objects perfectly, but my OCD made it a little frustrating. I did not do any deep-diving to see how I can get thins more accurate in Godot. 



-Instancing comparison (1–2 sentences): Prefabs vs Blueprint Actors vs Packed Scenes — what felt the same, what felt different:
Godot's packed scenes seem extremely simple in comparison to the other two, with Unreal being the most complex (at least in set-up) and Unity being the most intuitive. Both Unity and Unreal feel very similar in their ability to quickly copy a prefab or Blueprint Actor that has already been made and fleshed-out.



-Your pick (1 sentence): If you had to rebuild the same level again, which engine would you choose and why:
Because I have the least experience in Godot, I would use either Unity or Unreal to rebuild a level, though I think I would prefer Unreal with its incremental rotation and translation.
